The unofficial fork of the Tiny Parser Generator by Herre Kuijpers.

It is an LL(1) recursive descent parser generator written in C# which can generate a scanner, parser, and parsetree file in either C# or VB code.

The original code and documentation can be found in the article ['A Tiny Parser Generator v1.2' on CodeProject](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/28294/a-Tiny-Parser-Generator-v1-2
